## Plugin synchronization

### Mono plugin

Instead of installing a lot of plugins, you can limit the number of plugins by centralizing all tasks/specs you want into a dedicated plugin.

See [Reusing functions from other plugins](/docs/advanced_guides/plugin_development/writing_tasks/#reusing-functions-from-other-plugins)
